		\item Some of these have known detrimental effects on early-life cognitive outcomes
		\item Closure of coal-fired plants has been associated with improvements in cognitive outcomes

(Possible) Causal questions of interest:
    \begin{description}
      \item[Causal independent exposure-response] How does the population average MDI change as we increase Arsenic but hold other exposures constant
      \item[Causal joint exposure-response] How does the population average MDI change as we increase all exposures by the same amount
      \item[Causal attributable difference] How does the population average MDI change after we eliminate all/some exposures?
      \item[Causal generalized impact difference] How does the population average MDI change after we reduce all/some exposures by some policy-relevant amount?
    \end{description}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{A note on study questions}
Causal inference allows us to ask questions with answers that make sense to people who don't know what regression is, without sacrificing rigor
\bigskip

I always encourage students to ask causal questions because it helps focus and choose methods even when causality is hopeless.
