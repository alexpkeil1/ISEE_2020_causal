  \frametitle{Historical note}
    Yesterday (2020-01-06) armed insurrectionists, at the suggestion of the sitting president of the US, broke through police barricades and entered the US Capitol building in Washington DC. 
    The riot was timed to coincide with the proceedings at which the peaceful transfer of executive power was to occur.  
    As of now, 14 DC Metropolitan police officers were injured during the riot, and 4 individuals died including 1 as a result of a gunshot wound inside the Capitol building. 
    Multiple pipe bombs and molotov cocktails were found in the subsequent cleanup.
    Metropolitan police officers were shown, on camera, explicitly allowing some rioters into the Capitol, and assisting rioters as they left the building, without arresting them.
    The sitting US president and members of the US legislative branch continue to openly assert, against all evidence, that the incoming US president was elected fraudulently and are openly advocating for selective disenfranchisement of citizens of their country and denying, against evidence, the role of their supporters in the riots.
